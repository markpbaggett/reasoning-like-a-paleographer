## Unlocking AMC Early Presidents

How does a machine learn to read the past? This digital exhibit explores the intersection of archival history and
Artificial Intelligence through the personal correspondence of Texas A&M’s early presidents. By utilizing Handwritten
Text Recognition (HTR) and the IIIF Paleography utility, we do more than just transcribe "ink on page." We leverage
Google Gemini to reveal the AI’s "Chain of Process" reasoning—demonstrating how a modern model interprets 19th-century
cursive, navigates historical shorthand, and mirrors the trained eye of a professional paleographer. Step inside to
see the letters, the transcriptions, and the digital logic that brings them to life.

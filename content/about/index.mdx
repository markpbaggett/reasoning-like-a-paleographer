This exhibit demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to transcribe historic handwritten letters through Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR). By revealing the model’s reasoning process, it shows how closely AI interpretation mirrors the trained eye of a paleographer.

# About the Project

### Bridging the Gap Between Ink and Digital Text

For decades, the personal correspondence of Texas A&M’s earliest leaders remained locked behind the beautiful but difficult cursive of the 19th and early 20th centuries. While digitization has made these letters available as images, the "data" within them—the names, the struggles of a burgeoning university, and the nuances of campus life—remained largely unsearchable and inaccessible to modern screen readers.

**Using AI to Read Historic Letters** is an experimental digital exhibit that explores how **Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR)** can unlock these archives. By leveraging the **Google Gemini** multimodal model, we transform static images into dynamic, searchable, and interpreted text.

### The Vision: Transparency in Transcription

Traditional AI HTR transcription often operated as a "black box"; a user provided an image, and the model provided text
with little explanation of how it arrived at its conclusion. Occassioanally, the model may *hallucinate* leading to poor
results and mistrust.

**AI Reasoning**, or using multiple models in a feedback loop, results in amazing results and according to
[an article by Dan Cohen](https://newsletter.dancohen.org/archive/the-writing-is-on-the-wall-for-handwriting-recognition/),
performs transcription the same way you are "taught to do in a paleography class."

By utilizing the [**IIIF Paleography**](https://github.com/markpbaggett/iiif_paleography) utility, we ask the AI to
perform two distinct tasks for every letter:

1.  **Transcribe:** Create a highly accurate, marked-up version of the text with minor structural markup.
2.  **Rationalize:** Provide a "commentary" annotation that explains why certain words were chosen, how the model handled difficult handwriting, and how it utilized historical context to fill in the blanks.


### Our Methodology

This exhibit is powered by three core pillars:

* **The Archive:** IIIF manifests of original letters from the Texas A&M University AMC Early President collections.
* **The Standard:** The [**International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)**](https://iiif.io/), which allows us to serve high-resolution images and attach annotations directly to each page.
* **The Intelligence:** Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a "digital paleographer" to interpret the unique flourishes and abbreviations of historical script.

### Why This Matters

This project isn't just about speed; it's about **accuracy and trust.** By revealing the reasoning process, we allow
libarians, archivists, historians, students, and archivists to see where the AI excels and where it might struggle. This
dialogue between human expertise and machine learning paves the way for a future where historical archives are more
accessible, inclusive, and deeply understood.

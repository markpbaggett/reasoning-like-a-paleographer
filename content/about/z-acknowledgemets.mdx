# Acknowledgements

This exhibit is not only a result of technical engineering but also of a shared community effort to make AI-driven
transcription more transparent and scholarly.

The concept of **"Chain of Process"** reasoning revealing the internal logic of a model to validate its transcription
was deeply influenced by the insights and pioneering work of the following individuals:

* **[Ben](https://github.com/benwbrum) and [Sara Brumfield](https://github.com/saracarl) (Brumfield Labs)**: Pioneers in the world of collaborative transcription. Their work with [**FromThePage**](https://fromthepage.com/) and their advocacy for IIIF standards have set the bar for how digital archives should engage with both human volunteers and automated systems. Their insights into how a "human-in-the-loop" (or an "AI-mirroring-a-human") should function and their experiments with this technology first let me explore these models.
* **Dan Cohen**: Whose [recent article](https://newsletter.dancohen.org/archive/the-writing-is-on-the-wall-for-handwriting-recognition/) helped me understand that the model was behaving much like a trained paleographer.
* **Mark Humphries**: Whose [recent article](https://generativehistory.substack.com/p/gemini-3-solves-handwriting-recognition) convinced us all this was worth exploring.

# The Engine: IIIF Paleography

The core of this exhibit is powered by [**IIIF Paleography**](https://github.com/markpbaggett/iiif_paleography), an
open-source utility developed to make displaying the transcription and the reasoning easy.

While [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) (International Image Interoperability Framework) provides a powerful way to deliver high-resolution images,
it does not inherently "know" what is written on them. This tool acts as the translator.

## What is IIIF Paleography?

[IIIF Paleography](https://github.com/markpbaggett/iiif_paleography) is a Python-based utility designed to automate the
transcription and analysis of historical documents. It interacts with the [**IIIF Presentation API**](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/)
to fetch document manifests, extract their individual canvases, and process them through the **Google Gemini API**.

### The Technical Workflow

1.  **Manifest Ingestion**: The utility accepts a IIIF Manifest URL (e.g., a letter from a Texas A&M President).
2.  **Canvas Processing**: It iterates through every page (canvas) in the manifest.
3.  **AI Orchestration**: It sends the high-resolution image link to Google Gemini along with a highly tuned [System Prompt](https://github.com/markpbaggett/iiif_paleography/blob/main/prompts/gemini-htr.md).
4.  **Annotation Generation**: It receives two types of data back from the AI:
    * **Transcript**: The literal text.
    * **Commentary**: The reasoning behind the transcription.
5.  **Standardized Output**: The utility packages these results into **W3C Web Annotations**, making them compatible with modern IIIF viewers like Clover, Theseus Mirador, or Universal Viewer.

## Key Features

### Standards-Compliant Output

By generating valid **IIIF Annotation Pages**, the utility ensures that the transcriptions aren't just stuck in a text
file. They are tethered to the specific image coordinates, allowing for features like:

* Searchable text overlays.
* Side-by-side view of original ink and digital text.
* Accessibility support for screen readers.

### Semantic Markup
Unlike basic OCR (Optical Character Recognition), this utility instructs the AI to use semantic HTML tags allowed by the
IIIF spec (such as `<p>`, `<span>`, and `<b>`). This preserves the structural integrity of the letter—distinguishing
between the body of the text, signatures, and marginalia.

### Automated Reasoning
The utility specifically requests the "Chain of Thought" reasoning that powers our **Commentary** section. This feature
is what transforms the tool from a simple transcriber into a digital paleographer.

### Integration in this Exhibit
In this exhibit, we have used this utility to process the collections of Texas A&M's early presidents. Every transcription you see was generated using this pipeline, demonstrating a scalable way to bring "dark archives" into the light of the digital age.
